    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop you will learn how to interact with the NEXUS system and its `nexuscli` python client module.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebooks, it is recommended that you read through some of the basic commands by following this link:  \n",
    "\n",
    "[Jupyter Notebook Basics](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the [2 - Running Code](2 - Running Code.ipynb) notebook provides a short walkthrough on how to use Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important hints:\n",
    "  - Clicking in a cell and pressing `ctrl + enter` will run that cell\n",
    "  - A cell is running as long as there is an asterisk `*` next to that cell. When the cell is finished running, a number will appear\n",
    "  - All cells in a Jupyter notebook are part of the same \"program\". Variables and methods defined in cells are available to other cells in the same notebook as long as you run the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the notebooks in this workshop run using the Python 3 kernel. The expectation is that you have basic python programming skills or are able to understand simple python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If needed, an introduction to Python 3 (Courtesy of [Twisted Hardware](https://github.com/TwistedHardware/mltutorial/blob/b90fb1983221a2b53666d92a908dac015cf230b2/notebooks/jupyter/3.%20Python%20Basics.ipynb)) is provided in the [3 - Python Basics](3 - Python Basics.ipynb) notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important hints:\n",
    " - In python `datetime` objects can be created using the constructor `datetime(int: year, int: month, int: day)`. For example: `a_date = datetime(2016, 11, 1)`\n",
    " - Lists are considered sequences. To construct a list in python use square brackets. For example: `my_list = [\"This list contains one string\"]`\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## nexuscli Python Client\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop uses the `nexuscli` python client module. The source code for this module can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/dataplumber/nexus/tree/master/client). Documentation is available [as html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataplumber/nexus/a033052f3113c377b95361e3ad05ce07f5ecd41d/client/docs/nexuscli/nexuscli.m.html) and can also be viewed directly in Jupyter notebook by importing the module, running the cell, typing `nexuscli`, and then pressing `shift + tab`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two datasets available for analysis during this workshop:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AVHRR_OI-NCEI-L4-GLOB-v2.0\n",
    "  - Timeframe available: 2005 - 2016\n",
    "  - [Dataset Description](http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/AVHRR_OI-NCEI-L4-GLOB-v2.0)\n",
    "2. TRMM_3B42_V7\n",
    "  - Timeframe available: 2005 - 2015\n",
